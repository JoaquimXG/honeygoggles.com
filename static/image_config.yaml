  caption: "Hi friends! Long time no post \uD83D\uDC40 the people have spoken in my\
    \ story, and with a solid 85% preference, a short flip through video wins for\
    \ looking at my sketchbook! However, light conditions have been awful in these\
    \ days, so I\u2019m hoping I can film one soon, perhaps tomorrow or Wednesday\
    \ \uD83D\uDE4F meanwhile, here are four random pages! A quick note on how I use\
    \ it: this notebook has a very special meaning to me (which I will explain in\
    \ the future perhaps) and it almost serves as \u201Ctherapy\u201D. It\u2019s a\
    \ place of nostalgia, where I try and draw with absolutely no expectations. That\
    \ can mean coloring badly (because this paper is really crap, and also because\
    \ coloring badly is fun), it can mean doing loads of fanart and screencap studies,\
    \ or it can mean doodling new characters. No rules whatsoever! You\u2019ll see\
    \ a lot of Sailor Moon (which actually wasn\u2019t even my favourite shojo) and\
    \ a bit of a new oc in there. \n\nI want to try and work in this more, as I really\
    \ missed drawing traditionally. Digital art is super convenient, but there\u2019\
    s something super satisfying about doodling in ink or random cheap pencils! I\
    \ hope this inspires you to work in your sketchbook/notebook too, because there\u2019\
    s really nothing like it! If you\u2019ve read this far, one last thing: my ghost\
    \ comic is sitting there half finished, but my eyes are doing better today, so\
