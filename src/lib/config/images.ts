However, light conditions have been awful in these days, so I\u2019m hoping I can film one soon, perhaps tomorrow or Wednesday \ud83d\ude4f meanwhile, here are four random pages! A quick note on how I use it: this notebook has a very special meaning to me (which I will explain in the future perhaps) and it almost serves as \u201ctherapy\u201d. It\u2019s a place of nostalgia, where I try and draw with absolutely no expectations. That can mean coloring badly (because this paper is really crap, and also because coloring badly is fun), it can mean doing loads of fanart and screencap studies, or it can mean doodling new characters. No rules whatsoever! You\u2019ll see a lot of Sailor Moon (which actually wasn\u2019t even my favourite shojo) and a bit of a new oc in there. \n\nI want to try and work in this more, as I really missed drawing traditionally. Digital art is super convenient, but there\u2019s something super satisfying about doodling in ink or random cheap pencils! I hope this inspires you to work in your sketchbook/notebook too, because there\u2019s really nothing like it! If you\u2019ve read this far, one last thing: my ghost comic is sitting there half finished, but my eyes are doing better today, so it will come this week \ud83d\ude4f \n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#sketchbook #sketching #sketchoftheday #sketchbookdoodles #sketchbookdump #sailormoonfanart #sailormoon #sailormoonart #originalcharacter #inkdrawing',

(I can't film videos to save my life and I also have a new phone so this looks fairly embarrassing but bear with me while I learn \ud83d\udc40) \nAbout this sketchbook: it's very inexpensive, paper is crappy, I use it mainly for fanart, fun collages, OCs, nice little quotes and stickers (my new obsession, please help me). I know loads of people have an \"ugly sketchbook\" where they try and develop their style freely. While it might look like that's what this is, I would say this is actually closer to my school diary when I was 8 (i.e. a place to draw my favourite animes and to store all my stickers). I usually do studies or style exploration on loose pieces of paper, because I prefer drawing big. So perhaps this is more a peek into my journal \ud83d\ude05 I truly enjoy doodling in here though, and you still discover things about your art even when you redraw Sailor Moon \ud83c\udf19  can't wait to finish it so I can show you a proper tour!\n\n#sketchbooktour #sketchbook #artjournal #sailormoonfanart #sailormoon #studioghiblifanart #mangapanel #sailormoonaesthetic #animeart #90sanime #90sanimeaesthetic",
